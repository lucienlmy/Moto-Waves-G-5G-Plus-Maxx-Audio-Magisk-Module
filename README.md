## Installation Guide
- Install the module via Magisk Manager only.

- You can install [Audio Compatibility Patch Ryuki Mod](https://github.com/reiryuki/Audio-Compatibility-Patch-Ryuki-Mod) module for processing all audio outputs.

- Reboot.

- If this module still not working properly, remove/disable your built-in soundfx or deactivate the library and effect through your audio_effects.xml and audio_effects.conf.

- Open Moto Audio app using equalizer option in your Music app and tap 'Show icon in the app tray' for showing Moto Audio app icon launcher.

- Tap 'About' then tap multiple times there if you want to disable FX for loudspeaker.

- If sometime you installing Moto Camera One + feature support but it's crash, keep it installed, then reboot your device. It will be working fine after reboot.

## Optional
- Install Audio Modification Library module or [ACDB module](https://t.me/viperatmos) (choose one, don't use both!) if you want to use multiple audio mods together with Dolby or Viper or any else.

- Moto Waves v2.0 and up can be working together with Moto Dolby v1.2 and up. Use AML or ACDB for it.

## Attention!
- Always make nandroid backup before install or updating version, these are just experiments!

- I only test this on my Redmi 4A rolex AOSP Android 10. Android 11 or other devices may not work.

- Please open issues with logcat if you got problems. Don't report anything without logcat!

- Special thanks to @guitardedhero, @foxtrot47, and all people that helped and tested my modules.

- Free to cheat/kang my works, but please give a credit @reiryuki.
