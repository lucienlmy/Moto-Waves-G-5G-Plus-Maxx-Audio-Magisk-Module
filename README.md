## Guide

- Reboot

- Open Moto Audio app using equalizer option in your Music app and tap 'Show icon in the app tray' for showing Moto Audio app icon launcher.

## Attention!
Always make nandroid backup before install or updating version, these are just experiments!

I only test this on my Redmi 4A rolex AOSP Android 10. Android 11 or other devices may not work.

Now this module supports Audio Modification Library module, also [ACDB module](https://t.me/viperatmos), but still can be stand alone.

Please open issues with logcat if you got problems. Don't report anything without logcat!

Special thanks to @guitardedhero, @foxtrot47, and all people that helped and tested my modules.

Please give a credit @reiryuki if you want to cheat/kang my works.
