Install Audio Compatibility Patch Module too at Magisk Download for processing all audio sessions
but in "skip notification helper remover" please choose "yes". If choose no, it will conflict with ACDB Module.

Reboot

Open Moto Audio app using equalizer option in your Music app and tap 'Show icon in the app tray' for showing Moto Audio app icon launcher.

### Attention!
Do not install Audio Modification Library Module, because it will conflict with ACDB Module.

Please open issues with logcat.txt and screenshots if you got problems.

Special thanks to all people that helped and tested my modules.
